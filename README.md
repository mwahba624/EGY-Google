# 18 MERN: Book Search Engine![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description 

This project is a refactored version of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine. The original RESTful API has been replaced with a GraphQL API built using Apollo Server. The application is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and allows users to search for books, save them to their accounts, and manage their saved books.This project is a refactored version of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine.
